               Named after one of the most popular characters in the game, Mortal Kombat, Raiden, a design student at San Francisco State University is working towards his degree. Originally from Porterville California, which is near the fresno area, Raiden grew up in a small town and is now a majoring in Visual communication Design. Through many years, he took retail jobs at Macys,Ups,and Nordstrom, working his way through college while at the same time gaining work experience. The goal in terms of design, is to make work for clients that is satisfactory to their needs but also has a hint of Raidens identity in it. Graphic design is his main interest however, he wouldnt be opposed to other feilds of design, like web design for instance. Applying certain skills to other things is important, you dont want to feel subject to just one thing. Outside of work and school, Raiden likes to listen to and make music. He hangs out with friends and family,plays a video game here and there,and watches his favorite movies and Tv shows.For him, the future holds many possibilities.
